# What is Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

## git init

The git init command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository.

To run the command, the synthax is `git init`

## Git Commit

The "commit" command is used to save your changes to the local repository. Note that you have to explicitly tell Git which changes you want to include in a commit before running the "git commit" command. This means that a file won't be automatically included in the next commit just because it was changed.

The synthax is `git commit -m "initial message"`
